ROS: Embedded Edition Subscribers


There are two methods of subscribing to a topic, the subscribe
function and the timed subscribe function. These function connect
to the master node through the file named masterSub.ipc in the
tmp directory over nanomsg's request responce protocol. There
is a one second sleep timer imediatly after it connects as to
prevent nanomsg from dropping the request. Next the name of the
topic you wish to subscribe to is send to the master. This
name must be a valid C string of less than 100 characters 
including the null terminator. The master node sends back a 
new file name for communication between a thread in the master
 node and the subscriber. The subscriber sets up communication
to the master node through the new file using nanomsg's pair
protocol. Next the node waits for the master to send it the 
file paths to the publishing nodes. Once a new file path is
recieved the subscriber node spins up a new thread for listening
to the topic. This new thread connects to the publisher using
nanomsg's subscribe protocol. Next, if you used the timed 
subscribe function the funciton will sleep for that number of seconds, it will wait for data to published. Once there is 
data published it will do any nessisary memory allocation and
copy the data into the array pointed to by the info void
pointer.

The memory usage of the subscribe function is ~13kb adding 
~2-3kb for each publisher.
